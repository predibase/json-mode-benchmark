# JSON Mode Case Study and Benchmark

* `conllpp.csv` is a version of the [CoNLL++ dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/conll) that's been preprocessed to be more suitable for training an LLM on the NER task.
* `benchmark.ipynb` is a notebook illustrating how the LLM can be evaluated against test data.
* The benchmarks directory contains the result of running the LLM over the test dataset with each combination of fine-tuned adapter and JSON schema.
